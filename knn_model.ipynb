Then you can compute the squared Euclidean distances by hand, and compare it with the result of your code.  See the last four lines of the following code block, which lie outside the definition of `my_euclidean_dist`.  You can uncomment them for testing, but comment them back when you finish the entire lab.\n",

After executing all commands and completing this notebook, save your `Lab_2.ipynb` as a PDF file, named as `X_Y_UIN.pdf`, where `X` is your first name, `Y` is your last name, and `UIN` is your UIN. Make sure that your PDF file includes all parts of your solution, including the plots. \n",
